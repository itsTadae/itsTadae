This project is a random password generator. 

The generator allows the user to make a randomly generated password with a custom length of characters.

The length of the password can vary between 1 and 50 characters.

The user can then copy and paste the password to their 'clipboard' with a click of a button.

This is followed with an alert that notifies the user that their password has been "copied to clipboard".
